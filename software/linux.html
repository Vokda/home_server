	<q> Do have a moment for our Lords and Saviours Torvalds & Stallman? </q>
	<p>
	Obviously a joke. But more importantly...
	</p>
	</p>
	The best operating system hands down.
	<b>Actually...</b> <i>pushes up glases slightly further on the nose</i> Linux is just the kernel.
	<p>
	Well, not everyone knows that. True, Linux is actually just the kernel.
	To compare it to something more biological:
	If you were to remove the corresponding part in a human you'd lobotomize the human (hypothalamus?).
	Don't try it at home.
	</p>

	<p>
	Linux is usually used as an umbrella term as there are a whole lot of OSs that uses it.
	You may have heard of <a href=https://ubuntu.com/>Ubuntu</a> or perhaps any of the other OSs based on it:
	Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Mate etc... Personally I prefer <a href=https://debian.org/>Debian</a>.
	You can find most of the different Linux flavours on <a href='https://distrowatch.com/'>Distrowatch.com</a>
	</p>

	<p>
	But why Linux? Doesn't Windows or Mac "just work"&trade;?
	Sure, but I find that those systems can be quite limiting at times.
	If you just want to browse the internet, play games or write text (which of course is best done in <a href='#vim'>vim</a>) then maybe you have not felt hindered in any way by your
	system.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, delving deeper into the system reveals many locked doors, behind which may be untold riches.
	Or maybe just some file that <i>needs</i> to be there. Changing it cause invisible forces to undo your changes.
	Or crash the system. Who knows. The point is it is your computer and you should not be limited to what you can and cannot do with it.
	Below are a few stories about my linux adventures.
	</p>
	<h3>The Startup Sound</h3>
	<p>
	Back in the day, <b>before I had seen the light, before I was on the right path, before blessings were upon me,</b> I still used Windows.
	It "just worked"&trade;. Then one day I decided that I was gonna change the startup sound. 
	I wanted the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO9q4H49cGA>Windows 3.1 startup sound</a>. Ta-da! The perfect way to start a computer!
	</p>
	<p>
	So I set out on my quest. 
	I found a program that could change system sounds. I tried to change it here.
	<strong>APPLY</strong> said the button I pressed. No protests. That should be it.
	One reboot I saw through the system's lies.
	But I was not going to give up so easliy.
	</p>

	<p>
	After some time I found a folder with a bunch of system sounds. All normal WAV files. They could be played like any other file.
	Playing it once let me know I had found the right file.
	I tried to change it.
	<strong>Only the administrator has permission to change the file</strong> the computer let me know.
	I thought I was that person. I'm the only user after all. 
	After some additional fiddling, making myself the administrator, I tried again.
	<strong>Only a trusted installer has permission to change the file</strong> the computer let me know.
	How am I not the "trusted installer"? I installed it!
	</p>

	<p>
	I started to make backups of everything I had on the computer that I wanted to save.
	Saved game states, pictures, code, anything I wanted to bring along to the new system.
	Changing it on Debian was about as much a quest as it is to find milk in the grocery store.
	Nowadays I've messed with my system so much I don't even know if I have a startup sound anymore. 
	I don't really care though. There are yet depths I have not explored.
	</p>

	<h3>Removing the Beep</h3>
	<p>
	At my new job I received a computer. 
	It ran Linux. Oh, joy! :)
	Like any system, it let me know when I did something wrong. It did this in form of a beep.
	It was OK with the occasinal error I made.
	It beeped when pressing backspace on an empty line.
	It happened too often.
	it became too much.
	I removed the beep from individual programs.
	The beeping continued.
	I removed it from the system.
	The beeping continued.
	I removed the driver enabling my computer to beep.
	It could try and beep as much as it liked now.
