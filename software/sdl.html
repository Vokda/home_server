<h2>Software Development Libraries</h2>

	<h3 id=SFML>SFML</h3>
	Simple and Fast Multimedia Library.

	<p>
	A C++ library for developing software.
	I've used for game development and graphics in other programs.
	For example, me and a friend made 
	<a href='https://github.com/carleryd/Block-Frog'>Blockfrog</a> with SFML.
	It's quite easy to setup graphics, sounds, and networking with it.
	It is in general quite easy assuming you know C++.

	You can find it <a href=https://www.sfml-dev.org/ target=_blank>here</a>.

	<h3 id=SDL>SDL</h3>
	Simple Directmedia Layer.
	<p>
	A C library for developing software.
	I have used it for graphics in programs and have plans for using it in a future
	game.
	I find that SDL is somewhat  harder to use than SFML.
	But my understanding is that it has a larger community and is more widely
	used by "real" games.
	Also Steam supports it. That makes it handy if
	you plan on releasing your game on Steam.
