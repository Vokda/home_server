	<h2>Vim</h2>
	<p>
	A text editor. 
	And in order to contribute to the eternal flame war: The very best editor. 
	Fight me, Emacs users!
	</p>
	Jokes aside, I'm sure we can all agree they are both great text editors in their
	own way.
	You can find Vim 
	<a href=www.vim.org/>here</a> and Emacs 
	<a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>here</a>.
	<p>
	As mentioned earlier, Vim is a text editor. That is a progam which one edits
	texts with. Vim stands from Vi Improved. Vi in turn is an even older text
	editor.
	</p>
	Why use an ancient text editor you ask? Because it runs everywhere.
	It's a small editor that does not require much of your computer. It is very
	useful if you only have (or only want) to do things in a terminal.
	</p>

	<p>
	Vim is not the easiest text editor to start out with,
	but if you take your time to learn it properly you'll never want to go back.
	It's probably the same with Emacs. I don't since I never bothered to learn it.
	</p>

	<p>
	Personally I <a href='https://neovim.io'>Neovim</a> (or nvim for short) if it's available. It's a modernized verison of
	vim if you will.
	</p>

	<p>
	One point of critique against Vim:
	It's regex is all kinds of fucked up.
	It should follow the Perl standard.
