<h3>Simcity 4 Region Generator</h3>
<p>
This is a program that generates random regions with city plots for Simcity 4.
The terrain is based on heightmaps that are generated using simplex noise.
Once terrain and city plots have been generated, the latter by hand, it can be
imported to Simcity 4 and played on like any other map.
</p>

<p>
This is a work in progress. 
City plot generation is incomplete at the moment, but it is easy to do them
manually. See the readme.
There <i>should</i> some way of automating imports in Simcity 4 but I am yet to find
one. Doing it manually is a bit cumbersome, see readme.
