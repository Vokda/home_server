<h3>Personal Website</h3>
<p>
My personal website. You are looking at it right now.
Enjoy! :)
</p>

<p>
It is mostly written in PHP.
I have heard a lot of people talking shit on PHP so I decided to try it out for my website.
</p>

<p>
And they're mostly right. 
The one thing that's neat is that you can mix html and php together.
It's nice when you need to generate <i>parts</i> of an html document.
It is of course possible to do in other languages, but I find PHP works well for that.
</p>
<p>
...but other than that I can see why people shit on it.
