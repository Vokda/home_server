<h3>Name Generator</h3>
This is a rewrite of my app Danielian Name Generator in perl.
The app's old source code is archive away somewhere on my system and rather than 
finding it to fix its minor bugs I rewrote it. Besides, perl is nicer than java.
</p>
<p>
Current limitations:
<ul>
	<li>No dynamic name lengths</li>
	<li>Cannot change letter frequency</li>
	<li>The same two letters will not occur in a row</li>
</ul>
Fixes:
<ul>
	<li>More than three of the same letter will not occur anymore.</li>
	<li>Removed unnecessary "work-around functions" for names that would be unpronounceable, e.g. "bkkkktv"</li>
	<li>Previous point did not work anyway, name generated is pronouncable from the beginning now.</li>
</ul>
