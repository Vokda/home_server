My personal website. It can be enjoyed here:
http://www.devdaniel.eu

use spine

For a future update:
- I might change so that none of the content is put on git. 
  That's not the interesting part of the code after all. 
  I already do it for images and my projects so why not text?

- I think I'll continue working on latex->html scripts as
  I have several pages of text on the website and html is
  not the most comfortabe language to write in.
  
- Most of my scripts that generate text of one kind or another 
  should be possible to make into a service. 
  Even the sc4_terrain_gen since it only produces one image.
