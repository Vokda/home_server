My personal website. It can be enjoyed here:
http://www.devdaniel.eu

For a future update:
- I think I'll continue working on latex->html scripts as
  I have several pages of text on the website and html is
  not the most comfortabe language to write in.
  
- Most of my scripts that generate text of one kind or another 
  should be possible to make into a service. 
  Even the sc4_terrain_gen since it only produces one image.

- Forum could have been structured better.
