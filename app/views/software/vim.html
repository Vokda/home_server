	<h2>Vim</h2>
	<p>
	A text editor. 
	And for my contribution to the eternal flame war: The very best editor. 
	Fight me, Emacs users!
	</p>
	Jokes aside, I'm sure we can all agree they are both great text editors in their
	own way.
	You can find Vim 
	<a href=www.vim.org/>here</a> and Emacs 
	<a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>here</a>.
	<p>
	As mentioned earlier, Vim is a text editor. It is about as old as I am.
	Vim stands from Vi Improved. Vi in turn is an even older text editor.
	</p>
	<p>
	Why Vim?
	<ul>
		<li>It is a text editor first and foremost. It has one job and does it well.</li>
		<li>It runs on most systems, be it Linux or some other non-*nix OS</li>
		<li>It does not require much of your computer. Probably because it's ancient.</li>
		<li>It is very useful if you only can (or want) to do things in a terminal.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	Vim is not the easiest text editor to start out with,
	but if you take your time to learn it properly you'll never want to go back.
	It's probably the same with Emacs. I don't known since I never bothered to learn it.
	</p>

	<p>
	Personally I run <a href='https://neovim.io'>Neovim</a> (or nvim for short) if it's available. 
	It's a modernized verison of Vim.
	</p>

	<p>
	One point of critique against Vim:
	It's regex is all kinds of fucked up.
	It should follow the Perl standard.
